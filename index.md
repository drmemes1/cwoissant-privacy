## Data We Collect

### Account Information

**Apple ID authentication:** When you sign in with Apple, we receive your name and email (or a private relay email if you choose to hide it). We use this solely to create and manage your account.

### Data You Provide

- **Profile information:** Your name, wake time, leave time, home address, work address, news topic preferences, stock tickers, and peak focus time. This data powers your personalized morning briefing.
- - **Life Goals:** The personal goals you set during onboarding and throughout the app.
  - - **Evening check-in responses:** Your daily body feel, bedtime satisfaction, effort, and mood ratings, along with goal completions, day tags, and notes for tomorrow.
    - - **Morning Five game results:** Your trivia scores and game performance.
      - - **Morning Circle data:** If you join a Circle, your shared mood, Life Score, and game scores are visible to other members of your Circle — only when you actively choose to share.
       
        - ### Data Collected Automatically
       
        - - **Location data:** Used only to provide weather forecasts and commute estimates. Your location is processed on-device using Apple's frameworks (WeatherKit, MapKit, CoreLocation). We do not store your precise location on our servers.
          - - **Calendar data:** Read from your device's calendar using Apple EventKit to display your daily schedule. Calendar data is processed on-device and is not sent to our servers.
           
            - ---

            ## Data We Do NOT Collect

            - We do not read your emails, messages, or contacts.
            - - We do not collect browsing history.
              - - We do not collect health data from Apple HealthKit (this may be added as an optional feature in the future with explicit consent).
                - - We do not track you across other apps or websites.
                  - - We do not use advertising identifiers.
                   
                    - ---

                    ## How We Use Your Data

                    - **To provide the app's features:** Your profile data powers the morning briefing. Your check-in data generates your Life Score and insights. Your game results populate the leaderboard.
                    - - **To enable Morning Circle:** If you join a Circle, your shared data (mood, Life Score, game scores) is visible to your Circle members. You control what is shared through the daily "Share with Circle" prompt. By default, mood data is private.
                      - - **To send notifications:** Morning reminders, evening check-in prompts, and nudges from Circle members (if you enable notifications).
                        - - **To improve the app:** We may analyze anonymized, aggregated usage patterns to understand which features are most valuable. This data is never tied to individual users.
                         
                          - ---

                          ## Data Storage and Security

                          Your data is stored securely using Supabase, a cloud database platform with the following protections:

                          - All data is encrypted in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
                          - - Row Level Security (RLS) ensures that users can only access their own data and shared Circle data.
                            - - Authentication is handled through Apple Sign-In, which provides industry-standard security.
                              - - Your Supabase account data is hosted in secure data centers.
                               
                                - We retain your data for as long as your account is active. The app also caches data locally on your device for offline access.
                               
                                - ---

                                ## Data Sharing

                                **We do not sell your personal data. Ever.**

                                We do not share your data with advertisers. We do not share your data with third-party analytics platforms. We do not share your data with data brokers.

                                Your data is shared only in the following limited circumstances:

                                - **With your Morning Circle members:** Only data you actively choose to share (mood, Life Score, game scores) via the daily share prompt.
                                - - **With service providers:** We use Supabase for data storage and Anthropic's Claude API for trivia question generation. These services process data on our behalf under strict contractual obligations. No personal user data is sent to the trivia generation service — it only generates generic quiz questions.
                                  - - **If required by law:** We may disclose data if legally compelled by a valid court order or subpoena.
                                   
                                    - ---

                                    ## Your Rights and Choices

                                    - **Privacy controls:** In the app's Settings, you can control what data is shared with your Circle, toggle notification types on/off, and manage your profile information.
                                    - - **Data export:** You can request a copy of all your data by contacting us at the email below.
                                      - - **Account deletion:** You can delete your account and all associated data at any time through the app's Profile settings or by contacting us. Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
                                        - - **Circle sharing:** Mood and Life Score sharing with your Circle is opt-in on a daily basis. You choose each evening whether to share or keep your check-in private.
                                         
                                          - ---

                                          ## Children's Privacy
